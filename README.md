# Attiny85_ECG_PPG
this project uses aan Attiny 85 as an analog interface of the ECG and PPG sensors to monitor blood pressure , heartrate etc. 
the ADC interrupt for the attiny85 is used to send the ADC data to a computer where the serial data is plotted and computations are done 
to use the combination of ECG and PPG data to predict the blood pressure.

this is contributing in making a CUFFLESS blood pressure monitoring wearable which can be used by people with critical heart conditions 
to monitor their blood pressure continuously rather than using a big bulky machine repeatedly
